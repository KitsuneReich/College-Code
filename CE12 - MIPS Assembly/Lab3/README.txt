What were the learning objectives of this lab?
Learning how logic gates are utilized to make up the arithmetic parts of computer. Also, how computer use these gates to store information for later use. Further familiarizing ourselves with binary numbers and arithmetic and being able to turn a truth table into working logic circuits.  

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
I had some trouble initially getting the D flip-flop to work properly. I didn't catch that there needed to be an inverter connected to the clock signal. 

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I like how it's dressed up as a game, but it would help if the lab PDF better explained that the numbers are compared/stored dependent on the clock button press.
