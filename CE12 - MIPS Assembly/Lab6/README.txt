What was your design approach?
Start with the smallest block possible: Can I make a sound? Can I make the right sound? Can I make multiple sounds in a row, and the right number according to the song length? Are those the right sounds and so forth. . . Building up slowly from each stage.

What did you learn in this lab?
How to make sounds in MARS as well as keeping the return addresses straight by utilizing the stack when jumping around subroutines.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
I'm still not 100% confident that I have all the inputs/outputs for each subroutine correct. I had some issues understanding where $a0/$a1 needed to be set for each subroutine. I might have some that set it before the subroutine is called and some that are set after. Don't think this is good practice. For a while I was also confused about the tempo needed to be set and the previous rhythm. I was trying to just play my own song without setting a tempo, but then switched to working with the test file. Working with sound was pretty fun, though. And using the Mario Overworld tune was a great touch!

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I think this was a very unique and interesting lab. I already like the tie in with game music and getting to work with sound to reinforce stack principles is way more fun than another RPN calculator or something.
